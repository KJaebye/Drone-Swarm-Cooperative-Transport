This folder includes the CoppeliaSim simulator scenarios and models used in this project.
  1. /drone_project provides .ttm models that can be directly used in the simulator.
    please use the latest version drone_pro2.0.ttm
  2. /myfile provides scenarios. 
    ropeTest.ttt tests the performance of the rope
    drone_image_test.ttt tests the vision based relative localization performance
    try6.0(leader_follower).ttt tests the vision based relative localization performance
    try7.0circle.ttt is the circle shape load scenario
    try7.0circle_nobound.ttt is the circle shape load scenario
    try7.0concave.ttt is a H shape load scenario
    try7.0concave_nobound.ttt is a H shape load scenario
    try7.0rectangular.ttt is a rectangular shape load scenario
    try7.0rectangular_nobound.ttt is a rectangular shape load scenario
    
    for cooperative transport assignment please use:
    try9.0cylinder_nobound.ttt for cylinder profile load
    try9.0L_nobound.ttt for L profile load
    try9.0peanut_nobound.ttt for peanut profile load
    try9.0rectangular_nobound.ttt for rec profile load
    try9.0rectangular_steep_nobound.ttt for rec profile load with a steep edge
    
    for mass adapting topology network significance evaluation please use:
