int32 POSE=1
int32 POLYNOMIAL=2 # stores the coefficients of a polynomial in the waypoint fields. Coefficients are stored in increasing order, i.e. c0 + c1*t + c2*t^2 ...
int32 POLYNOMIAL_10=210 # polynomial with 10 coefficients, i.e. 9th order
int32 POLYNOMIAL_12=212 # polynomial with 12 coefficients, i.e. 11th order
